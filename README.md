List of installable add-ons for the Mozilla IoT Gateway. These are discoverable from the **Settings** page.

# Building Add-ons

The add-on API is described in [this document](https://github.com/mozilla-iot/wiki/wiki/Adapter-API).

# Packaging Add-ons

Your add-on should be packaged as an npm-compatible package. If it is written in Javascript and is actually npm-compatible, you can simply package it with `npm pack`. If not, the [layout](https://github.com/mozilla-iot/wiki/wiki/Add-On-System-Design#package-layout) needs to be the same.
